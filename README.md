# CyberPatriot manager

This is a program which can be used for CyberPatriot competitions that will automate some tasks that are meant for a computer to do, such as enabling all audit policies on success and failure

Will also provide other features such as scoring report management, and for designating a computer as a server and storing the scoring reports on that server to allow for not only looking at previous scoring reports, but at the scoring report of the image you are looking at if you choose to restart (as the data is stored on a different computer than the image)
